Dynamic DEM Construction
------------------------

A **detector error model** (DEM) relates independent fault mechanisms to the
detectors and logical observables they flip. CUDA-Q QEC already builds DEMs
from Stim circuits (``dem_from_memory_circuit``, ``dem_from_stim_text``). The
*dynamic DEM* interfaces add two complementary paths that do not require a
circuit:

1. **Matrix construction** — ``dem_from_css_matrices`` builds a
   :math:`T`-round code-capacity (or phenomenological) DEM directly from CSS
   generator matrices and noise rates.
2. **Composable chunks** — an :class:`~cudaq_qec.ExtendedDem` is one round (or
   phase) of that model. Stitch chunks across round boundaries and
   ``dem_close`` / ``dem_close_all`` to recover a flat
   :class:`~cudaq_qec.DetectorErrorModel`.

The chunk form is what streaming and real-time decoders need when the round
count is chosen at run time: the same init / bulk / final phase description
expands to any :math:`T \ge 2`, and helpers such as
``dem_chunks_to_d_sparse`` fill the ``D_sparse`` field of a decoder config.

Matrix construction
+++++++++++++++++++

``css_code_matrices`` (Python: ``CssCodes``) holds the four sparse CSS blocks
``hz``, ``hx``, ``lz``, ``lx``. ``css_noise_params`` (Python: ``CssNoise``)
supplies uniform or per-qubit / per-check rates ``px``, ``py``, ``pz``, and
optional measurement-error rate ``pm``.

With ``num_rounds = T``, each data-qubit fault in round :math:`r` contributes
to detector bands :math:`r` and :math:`r+1` (syndrome differences), except the
final round which touches only band :math:`T-1`. Measurement errors flip no
logical observable. The invariant

.. math::

   \mathrm{dem\_close}(\mathrm{dem\_stitch\_all}(
     \underbrace{c,\ldots,c}_{T}))
   \;=\;
   \mathrm{dem\_from\_css\_matrices}(\mathrm{code},\mathrm{noise},T)

holds for one-round chunks :math:`c` built by
``extended_dem_from_css_matrices``. Prefer ``dem_close_all`` when only the
closed DEM is needed: it is :math:`O(T)` rather than the left-fold
:math:`O(T^2)` of ``dem_stitch_all``.

Named seams and phases
++++++++++++++++++++++

Each chunk carries a single ``H`` matrix (all detector rows) plus a list of
named *seam descriptors* that identify which row bands participate in
stitching. Seam and phase identities are :class:`~cudaq_qec.SeamId` values —
lightweight wrappers around the FNV1a-32 hash of a name string — so the same
string always produces the same ID with no manual numbering.

Standard names for memory experiments:

* ``seam_name.prev_round`` / ``seam_name.next_round`` — incoming and outgoing
  syndrome boundaries.
* ``phase_name.init``, ``phase_name.bulk``, ``phase_name.final`` — standard
  phase constants whose string values are ``"init"``, ``"bulk"``, ``"final"``.
  Use the string form in YAML.

Phase specs and YAML ``dem_chunks``
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For asymmetric init / bulk / final rounds (for example dropping measurement
errors on a destructive final readout), describe each phase as a
:class:`~cudaq_qec.DemChunkSpec` and group them in a
:class:`~cudaq_qec.DemChunksSpec`. ``dem_chunks_from_spec(spec)`` expands to
``init``, ``num_rounds - 2`` copies of ``bulk``, then ``final`` according to
the ``connections`` list and ``num_rounds`` field inside ``spec``.

The ``H_sparse`` shorthand at chunk level means all seams share the same
syndrome rows (the memory case). ``seam_specs`` gives per-seam rows for
non-memory circuits.

Real-time decoder YAML accepts the same structure under ``dem_chunks``.
``num_rounds`` is optional: omit it for streaming decoders where the round
count is not known at configuration time. When ``H_sparse`` is empty, the
configuration is *chunk form*: ``expand_dem_chunks`` (called during decoder
construction) derives ``block_size``, ``syndrome_size``, ``H_sparse``,
``O_sparse``, and ``D_sparse`` from the closed DEM. A nonempty ``H_sparse``
keeps the config in flat form.

         connections:
           - {from: init, to: bulk}
           - {from: bulk, to: bulk}
           - {from: bulk, to: final}

         phases:
           - name: init
             spec:
               num_faults: 9

           - name: bulk
             spec:
               num_faults: 9
               H_sparse: [ 0, 1, 5, -1, 1, 2, 6, -1, 2, 3, 7, -1, 3, 4, 8, -1 ]
               O_sparse: [ 0, -1 ]
               error_rates: [ 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02 ]
           - name: final
             spec:
               num_faults: 5
               H_sparse: [ 0, 1, -1, 1, 2, -1, 2, 3, -1, 3, 4, -1 ]
               O_sparse: [ 0, -1 ]
               error_rates: [ 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.02 ]

The ``connections`` list encodes the phase graph. A self-loop
(``from: bulk, to: bulk``) identifies the repeating phase; ``num_rounds``
controls how many copies are inserted. For a linear chain with no self-loop
``num_rounds`` is not needed.

Duplicate fault columns
+++++++++++++++++++++++

After stitching, identical row-support columns can appear when the same
physical fault is modelled on both sides of a seam. ``dem_merge_duplicate_columns``
(or ``dem_stitch_merged``) collapses them. The default
:class:`~cudaq_qec.PriorCombineMode` ``or_combine`` uses the GF(2) / XOR rule
:math:`p = \tfrac12\bigl(1 - \prod_i (1 - 2 p_i)\bigr)`, matching DEM
canonicalization elsewhere in CUDA-Q QEC. ``sum_combine`` is a small-:math:`p`
linear approximation, clamped to :math:`[0, 1]`.

Closing and the outgoing seam
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``dem_close`` and ``dem_close_all`` drop the last chunk's outgoing seam
(``next_round`` by default): there is no later round for it to differ against.
The incoming seam rows (``prev_round``) appear first in the output so that
``detector[0]`` corresponds to ``syndrome[0]`` vs. the zero initial state.
Any detector that belongs only to the final boundary should be placed in the
``next_round`` seam of the preceding chunk, or in interior rows of the final
chunk.
